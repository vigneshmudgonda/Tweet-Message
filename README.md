 # Tweet-Message
Project Title : Tweet Message

Description:
The "Tweet Message" project is a web application built using the Django framework, designed to mimic core functionalities of a microblogging platform. Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own "tweets" (short text messages). The application also supports the inclusion of images with tweets and provides user authentication features, including registration, login, and logout.

Objective:
Core Functionality: To provide a platform where authenticated users can post short text messages, optionally accompanied by an image.
User Management: To implement a secure user authentication system allowing users to register, log in, and manage their own content.
Content Management: To enable users to easily create new tweets, and to modify or remove their existing tweets.
User Experience: To offer a straightforward and intuitive interface for interacting with the tweet functionalities.
Learning/Demonstration: To serve as a practical example of building a web application with Django, showcasing features like models, views, forms, templates, and user authentication.
